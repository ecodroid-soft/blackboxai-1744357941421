# Website Replica

## Project Overview
Website Replica is a simple web application that allows users to upload images through an admin panel. It serves as a demonstration of using PHP and integrates Bootstrap for responsive design. The project provides an interface for users to view featured projects and allows administrators to upload images into the application.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   cd website-replica
   ```
   
3. **Set Up a Web Server**:
   Ensure you have a web server with PHP support (like Apache or Nginx) installed. You may use XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for local development.

4. **Database Setup**:
    - Create a MySQL database.
    - Run the following SQL to create the necessary table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE images (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          image_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
      );
      ```

5. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update the `includes/db.php` file with your database credentials to establish a connection.

6. **Start the Web Server**:
   Access your project in the web browser at `http://localhost/website-replica/index.php`.
